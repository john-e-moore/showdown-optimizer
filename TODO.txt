x Post-contest sim; see if my stuff matches Sabersim's
 - Add 'Projections' tab (make it the first tab) with the original sabersim projections
 - Add 'Sum Ownership' and 'Salary-weighted Ownership' to 'Simulation' tab
 - Add 'Entries' column into 2nd column of 'Entrant summary' tab - the number of entries that entrant put into the contest
 - In 'Player summary' tab, add 'CPT proj ownership' and 'FLEX proj ownership' next to 'CPT draft %' and 'FLEX draft %'; these are the projected ownerships from the sabersim projections.
- Read DKEntries, curl contest, draftables, and payout info, and output filled DKEntries.
- Extend same method to NBA
- Data storage on S3
- Does DK API have endpoints for actual contest payouts? Seems like contests.json does not have it?
- Get higher sabersim plan for non-flagship ownership in showdown
